# Todo App

The Todo App is a dynamic web application built using React, TypeScript and CSS. It allows users to create new tasks, mark them as completed, delete them from the list and change their titles.

The application uses API and local storage to store the tasks, so the user's data will persist even if they close and reopen the browser.
